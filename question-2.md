# Blue/Green vs. Canary Deployment Strategies

Both **Blue/Green** and **Canary** are advanced deployment strategies designed to release a new version of an application with **zero downtime** and a mechanism for immediate rollback or failover. They differ significantly in their approach to risk and traffic management.

***

## 1. Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green deployment involves running **two identical, complete production environments** in parallel.

* **Blue:** The current, live production version serving all user traffic.
* **Green:** The new environment where the updated version is deployed, tested, and validated, but is idle to live traffic.

When ready, a load balancer or router **instantaneously switches** 100% of user traffic from the Blue environment to the Green environment.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rollout** | **All at once (binary switchover)**. Users are either on the old (Blue) or new (Green) version. |
| **Risk Mitigation** | **Immediate Rollback.** If a critical issue is discovered post-switch, traffic is instantly flipped back to the stable Blue environment. |
| **Infrastructure** | **High Cost.** Requires double the resources/infrastructure to maintain two full production environments simultaneously. |
| **Feedback** | **Limited.** Real-world user feedback and performance metrics are only gathered *after* the full 100% switch. |

## 2. Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves **gradually rolling out** the new version to a small, isolated subset of users or servers before releasing it to the entire user base. It takes its name from the practice of sending a canary bird into a coal mine as an early warning system.

* **Stable Version (Control):** Receives the majority of traffic (e.g., 95%).
* **New Version (Canary):** Receives a small, initial percentage of traffic (e.g., 5%).

If the canary proves stable, the percentage of traffic is **incrementally increased** (e.g., 5% $\rightarrow$ 25% $\rightarrow$ 75% $\rightarrow$ 100%) until the new version completely replaces the old one.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rollout** | **Gradual (phased rollout).** Traffic is shifted in small, controlled increments. |
| **Risk Mitigation** | **Small Blast Radius.** Issues only affect the small subset of users in the canary group, limiting the overall impact. |
| **Infrastructure** | **Lower Cost.** Often uses the same environment/infrastructure, requiring only additional servers/containers for the canary group. |
| **Feedback** | **Real-Time.** Allows for continuous monitoring, A/B testing, and gathering live performance data and user feedback at each stage. |

## 3. When to Choose One Over the Other

The choice depends primarily on your **risk tolerance**, **infrastructure resources**, and **need for live user feedback**.

| Choose **Blue/Green** When... | Choose **Canary** When... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rollback Speed is Paramount:** You need the fastest possible recovery time (near-instant rollback) to the previous known-good state. | **Risk Mitigation is Paramount:** You need to minimize the impact ("blast radius") of a potentially bad deployment to a small user group. |
| **Changes are Low-Risk/Well-Tested:** The update is straightforward (e.g., a simple patch) and has been thoroughly tested in staging. | **Changes are High-Risk/Complex:** The update involves significant new features, major architectural changes, or database schema changes. |
| **Zero-Downtime is Mandatory:** Your system has extremely high availability requirements, and a guaranteed zero-downtime switch is required. | **Live Data/Feedback is Required:** You need to validate performance, measure user behavior (A/B testing), or capacity test the new version under real production load. |
| **Resources are Abundant:** You have the infrastructure budget and capability to maintain two full, identical production environments. | **Resources are Limited/Controlled:** You have a smaller infrastructure budget or want fine-grained control over resource allocation. |
